# backdoor_v1
This a backdoor i made with python modules like socket, subprocess and threading. The backdoor is injected in a code of a little python-game and obfusced.


The backdoor work with a tcp server and a tcp client. The tcp server is make with the socket moodule and implemented in the love_test code. With the subprocess module,
the backdoor (tcp server) treat command send by the attacker (tcp client). The server run as like daemon with the threading module, for more discretion.
